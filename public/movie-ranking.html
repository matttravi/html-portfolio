<h1>The Best Movies Ever!!!!!</h1>
<h2>Matt Travi's top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990)</h3>
<p>I have to make sure to include the release year on this one, because I do not mean the Michael Bay version! This is a guilty pleasure movie of mine. It may not be an amazing movie by film standards, but it is amazing to me. I love the turtles, and this movie hits all that I want in a turtles movie. Nuff said.</p>

<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<P>This is a classic, and for good reason. It has such a good story that makes you really care for the characters. There is a lot of comedy, which makes the movie so quotable. Soundtrack is killer, and there is so much history that you can learn from this movie (As shown by the number of history classes in high school that show this film).</P>

<h3>Stars Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</h3>
<P>As a kid, I would pretend to be exploring and running down the corridors of the Death Star along with Luke, Han Solo and the gang as the movie played on in the background. This is the movie that started it all for so many Star Wars fans. This is definetely not just a movie I put on here for nostalgia purposes also. This movie still holds up for me today, especially when tied together with Episode III and the prequel trilogy.</P>
